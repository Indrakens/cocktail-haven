#
# DEPLOYMENT
* Sign-up / Log-in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
* From the main Heroku Dashboard page select 'New' and then 'Create New App'
* Give the project a name (app name must be unique) and select a suitable region, then select create app
* Heroku will create the app and bring you to the deploy tab
* From the submenu at the top, navigate to the resources tab 
* Add the database to the app, in the add-ons section search for 'Heroku Postgres', select the package that appears and add 'Heroku Postgres' as the database
* Click on the setting tab
* Open the config vars section copy the DATABASE_URL to the clipboard for use in the Django configuration
* In the Django app repository create a new file called env.py
* Within this file import the os library and set the environment variable for the DATABASE_URL pasting in the address copied from Heroku
* The line should appear as os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]= "Paste the link in here"
* Add a secret key to the app using os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key goes here"
* Add the secret key just created to the Heroku Config Vars as SECRET_KEY for the KEY value and the secret key value you created as the VALUE
* In the settings.py file within the django app, import Path from pathlib, import os and import dj_database_url
* Insert the line if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env
* Remove the insecure secret key that django has in the settings file by default and replace it with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
* Replace the databases section with DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))} ensure the correct indentation for python is used
* In the terminal migrate the models over to the new database connection
* Navigate in a browser to cloudinary, log in, or create an account and log in
* From the dashboard - copy the CLOUDINARY_URL to the clipboard
* In the env.py file add os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "paste in the Url copied to the clipboard here"
* In Heroku, add the CLOUDINARY_URL and value copied to the clipboard to the config vars
* Also add the KEY - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with the Value - 1 to the config vars
* This key value pair must be removed prior to final deployment
* Add the cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps, the order they are inserted is important, 'cloudinary_storage' goes above 'django.contrib.staitcfiles' and 'cloudinary' goes below it
* In the settings.py file - add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path
* Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]
* Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format will be the app name given in Heroku when creating the app followed by .herokuapp.com
* In your code editor, create three new top level folders, media, static, templates
* Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile
* Within the Procfile add the code - web: guincorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
* In the terminal, add the changed files, commit and push to GitHub
* In Heroku, navigate to the deployment tab and deploy the branch manually - watch the build logs for any errors
* Heroku will now build the app for you
* Once it has completed the build process you will see a 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site
